Check Your Understanding Questions
1. Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.

You would fit the automated tested within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed to ensure that the latest version does not have any bugs. This allows us to develop the code and know that it works before moving on. 

2. Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no)
NO. Unit testing is a better choice because of in a micro scale, it's much faster and more convenient.

3. What is the difference between navigation and snapshot mode?
The biggest difference between navigation and snapshot mode is that navigation analyzes the page right after it finishes loading while snapshot mode analyzes whatever the state is currently in. 

4. Name three things we could do to improve the CSE 110 shop site based on the Lighthouse results.
The first thing we could do is to properly size images to save cellular data and improve load time. The second thing we could do is preconnect to the api to save time (specifically fakestoreapi.com). The third thing we could do is to replace the backpack image since it is too large and takes too long to load.
